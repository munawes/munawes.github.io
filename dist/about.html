          Bio
        </h3>
        <p>I've spent my life searching for unique aspects in the mundane and focusing on the <em>why.</em></p>
        <p>My educational focus was in Creative Writing but I've found that the skills of observation and transformation are applicable across many different avenues. Being able to step into the shoes of a fictional character and tell their story is not much different than generating compelling copy for a client whom I've just met.  Countless hours spent in the peer-editing process allows me to have a keen eye for syntactical and grammatical composition in a variety of fields from creative and copywriting to technical manuals.</p>
        <p>Discovering the <em>why</em> behind things forces me to constantly expand my knowledge base, which is the main reason I embarked on teaching myself Front-End Web Development. Close friends and family members seemed to have trouble accessing the basic functions of web apps (or finding one that fit their needs), so I began to create applications and web pages with accessibility in mind.</p>
        <p><strong>Limitations are a thing of the past.</strong> Nearly everyone has the ability to find free or low-cost resources for proceeding down their desired path. I aim to be a conduit for that in everything that I do.</p>
